This project involved the development of a Snowflake Data Warehouse aimed at analyzing Netflix titles and IMDB classifications. The solution was designed using the Kimball methodology, focusing on building a robust and scalable data architecture for efficient querying and reporting. 
Key components of the project included:

    Data Ingestion (SSIS): Utilized SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) to automate the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of data from various sources into the Snowflake schema. 
    This enabled efficient data integration and ensured the accuracy and consistency of the data.

    OLAP Analysis (SSAS): Employed SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to build a multidimensional data model (OLAP cube), allowing for complex analytical queries and providing the ability to perform detailed slicing and dicing of the data across multiple dimensions such as genres, ratings, and release years.

    Reporting (SSRS): Developed interactive and dynamic reports using SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS), which provided business users with valuable insights into Netflix content trends, IMDB ratings, and other key performance indicators. 
    These reports were designed to be user-friendly, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions with ease.

This comprehensive data warehousing solution provided a centralized platform for analyzing entertainment content data and generating actionable insights, all while adhering to the best practices of the Kimball methodology."
